# Make Data Meaningful

## Hi there Github friends, 

This is Aranxa, a Mexican communication specialist with experience in strategic political communication, quantitative and qualitative research methods and a growing interest in the intersection of LLMs, NLP, media and democracy to develop educational misinformation tools. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Science for Public Policy at the [**Hertie School of Governance**](https://hertieschool-f4e6.kxcdn.com/en/mds).

### About Me
- I'm fascinated by how data can drive impactful decision-making, particularly in public policy for digital and media literacy.
- Currently I've been learning more on advanced techniques in deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, data visualization, and econometrics.
- I'm expanding my knowledge in ethical AI, open data governance, policy evaluation frameworks and misinformation.
- I'm always excited to collaborate on projects at the intersection of **data science**, **public policy**, and **social impact**.

- ðŸ“« **Reach me**: Feel free to connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aranxa-m%C3%A1rquez-ampudia-288b03b0/).

I'm a big fan of storytelling through data and love to explore the creative side of research ðŸ¥¸.

Looking forward to connecting and learning together!
