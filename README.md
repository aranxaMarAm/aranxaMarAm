# Make Data Meaningful

## Hi there Github friends, 

This is Aranxa, a Mexican communication specialist with experience in strategic political communication, quantitative and qualitative research methods and a growing interest in the intersection of LLMs, NLP, media and democracy to develop educational misinformation tools. I hold a Master in Data Science for Public Policy from the [**Hertie School of Governance**](https://hertieschool-f4e6.kxcdn.com/en/mds).

### About Me
- My main motivation is to find creative ways for data to have an impact on decision-making, particularly in public policy.
- Currently I'm currently looking for a place to work where I can start applying the learned techniques in deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, data visualization, and econometrics.
- I'm expanding my knowledge in geoeconomics and high-tech competition ethical AI, open data governance, policy evaluation frameworks and misinformation.
- I'm always excited to collaborate on projects at the intersection of **data science**, **public policy**, and **social impact**.
